# Mind The Gap In Academic Awards: An interactive EDI Dashboard for Exploring Student Metrics

## Project Overview  
- This project focuses on developing an interactive Equality, Diversity, and Inclusion (EDI) dashboard to support the exploration and analysis of student award outcomes in higher education.
- It is conducted in collaboration with the University of Westminster's Department of Social Sciences and uses simulated (dummy) student data designed to mirror real-world data.
- The dashboard aims to assist academics and institutional stakeholders in identifying awarding gaps and deliberating the best strategies to narrow them.

## Tools Used  
- Python (pandas, plotly, scikit-learn, catboost, shap, etc.)  
- Google Colab / Jupyter Notebooks  
- Power BI  
- GitHub for version control  
---

## Methodology 
- Data cleaning and transformation using Python.
- Exploratory data analysis.
- Inferential analysis and tree-based modelling. 
- Dashboard design and development in Power BI.
- Testing & Feedback.
- Documentation.

## Challenges and Limitations  
- Access to real student data is restricted due to ethical and legal requirements.  
- Simulated data may not capture all complexities of real institutional datasets.  
- Tree-based ensemble models provide limited transparency compared to simpler models.  
- Dashboard deployment depends on Power BI services.
